"""Version and build identity, for logs and the GUI.

The build number is a plain integer that increments on every build and
resets to 0 when ``__version__`` changes. Its only job is to let a user
and a developer agree on *which* build is in front of them: "I'm on
1.5.0 build 7" is unambiguous, which is all we need.

The counter lives in ``build_number.json`` at the repo root (checked in,
so it survives clean checkouts and is visible in history). The spec
bumps it at build time and bakes the result into ``_build_stamp.py``,
which is packed into the frozen kit.

Running from source reports ``dev`` rather than a number — a source tree
isn't any particular build, and claiming one would be the exact
confusion the number exists to prevent.
